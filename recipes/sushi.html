    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice, typically served with raw fish (sashimi), vegetables, and sometimes other ingredients like seaweed. It is commonly accompanied by soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>300 g of sushi rice</li>
      <li>350 ml of water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>200 g of raw fish (like salmon or tuna, sushi-grade)</li>
      <li>1 sheet of nori (seaweed)</li>
      <li>Soy sauce (for dipping)</li>
      <li>Wasabi and pickled ginger (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well.</li>
      <li>Place the rice and 350 ml of water in a pot and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for another 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a small saucepan, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat gently until the sugar dissolves, then let it cool.</li>
      <li>Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and gently fold in the vinegar mixture. Let the rice cool to room temperature.</li>
      <li>Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving a small border at the top.</li>
      <li>Place thin slices of raw fish (and any other desired fillings) on top of the rice.</li>
      <li>Roll the sushi tightly using the bamboo mat, then slice the roll into bite-sized pieces.</li>
      <li>Serve the sushi with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side.</li>
