    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      Feijoada is a Portuguese designation for a dish from the Transmontana cuisine that also became popular in other Portuguese-speaking countries such as Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Timor-Leste, and Macau. It consists of a bean stew, usually with meat, and is almost always served with rice.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kg of black beans</li>
      <li>500 g of sausage (4 units)</li>
      <li>3 onions</li>
      <li>5 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>¼ cup of olive oil</li>
      <li>3 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Place the beans in a sieve and rinse well under running water. Transfer the beans to a large bowl and cover with 2.5 liters of water – if any float, discard them. Cover with a plate and let soak for 30 minutes – if the beans soak too long, they may lose color and fall apart during the long cooking process of the feijoada. Meanwhile, pre-cook the meats.</li>
      <li>Drain the water from the desalted meats and transfer them to a large pot (or pan) with a capacity of 11 liters. Cover the meats with water and bring to high heat – about 4 liters are enough, the amount may vary depending on the size of the pan, but the meats should be completely submerged. Let cook for 10 minutes on high heat, counting after it starts to boil – this pre-cooking removes excess fat and salt from the meats.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onions and garlic cloves. With a small knife, remove the casing from the sausages. Drain the water from the beans.</li>
      <li>After 10 minutes, use a slotted spoon to transfer the pre-cooked meats to a large bowl and discard the cooking water, being careful not to burn yourself.</li>
      <li>Return the pot to high heat. Once heated, drizzle with olive oil, add the onion, and season with a pinch of salt. Sauté for about 8 minutes until it starts to brown. Add the garlic, cumin, and bay leaves and stir for 1 minute to release the aroma.</li>
      <li>Add the soaked beans to the sautéed mixture and mix well. Pour in 6 liters of water and keep the pan on high heat. Once it starts to boil, add the pre-cooked dried meat and ribs, lower the heat, and let it cook for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>After the first 2 hours of cooking, add the pre-cooked pork loin and whole sausages. Let it cook on low heat for another 3 hours, stirring occasionally to avoid breaking the beans.</li>
      <li>30 minutes before the cooking time ends, use tongs to transfer the sausages to a cutting board and cut each into 1 cm slices, diagonally. Return the slices to the pot and let them cook until the total 5 hours of cooking are complete, or until the meats are very tender and the feijoada broth begins to thicken. Serve with rice, sautéed collard greens, orange wedges, and toasted cassava flour.</li>
